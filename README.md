# hello-world
My first git repository
My name is kaleab tesfu and i'm pretty excited about learning how to use repositories and stuff.
I've heard so many people talk about this and i myself have downloaded some files for my projects but 
i have never fully interacted with it. I'm looking forward to 'Earning some green dots' lol.
Peace out.
